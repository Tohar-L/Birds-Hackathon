## Good
- Good idea
- Well structured project into folders
- Nice style

## Need Review
- Need to add more explanatory comments in the code
- Try to use camel came for the variable names
`birds_on_a_wire` or `birdsOnAWire`
- use `const` if the variable value is constant
- look at my feedbacks in the files `birds_on_wire.js` and `bear_eating_js`
